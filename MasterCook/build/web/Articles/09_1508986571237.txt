This would be no real hardship were not for the fact that even many non-meat eaters find that scotch eggs have a way of making eyes at you from the other side of the rug, flaunting their bright yolks and crunchy crumb in a way that’s really quite unreasonable.</div><div><br></div><div>The popularity of the scotch egg at such occasions is partly explained by the fact that, like the Cornish pasty, or the sausage roll, it’s a robustly portable sure-fire crowd pleaser that is likely to arrive in better condition than the unfortunate quiche or sweating salad; and given the existence of the vegetarian sausage, there seems no good reason that non meat-eaters should miss out. There are a few commercially produced examples on the market, but you can’t beat a freshly made scotch egg, the coating still crisp, the egg just warm – and, in most cases, that means getting stuck in at home.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/09_1508986285106.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div><b>The meat</b><br></div><div>Let’s start with the most important bit – the bit that isn’t sausage meat. Opinions diverge on the best replacement for meat in this context, with some, such as Gizzi Erskine’s Bombay potato version in her book My Kitchen Table making no attempt to recreate the flavour or texture of the original, and others, such as Deri Reed of the Ethical Chef, proudly declaring that people are often shocked when they find his tofu and chestnut-based take contains no meat. Jacqueline Meldrum’s recipe using vegetarian haggis seems to fall into the first camp, while the chipotle and chickpea eggs in Alice Hart’s book the New Vegetarian and Mark E Johnson’s stilton, walnut and apple numbers on his blog Yorkshire Grub, seem to cock a snook at the very idea of pork.<br></div><div><br></div><div>This leaves me with a problem. All five are delicious, though most of us find deep-fried blue cheese rather too rich a pairing for an egg. Hart’s pulse-based version, by contrast, is delicately flavoured enough to allow the egg itself to take centre stage, which reminds us – when we stop to think in between shovelling bits into our mouths – that if this is going to be at all faithful to the original, the filling ought to be the star. Sausage, though undoubtedly important, is definitely the best supporting actor in a scotch egg. This means that, much as we love Erskine’s warmly spiced potato jacket flecked with coriander and zingy with lemon juice, it doesn’t quite feel like a scotch egg in anything but basic concept. It’s also quite delicate to transport, which is an important factor in a picnic product.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/09_1508986303535.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div>Meldrum and Reed’s are the closest to the original ideal, though unfortunately the latter’s coating melts away in the fryer, somewhat puzzlingly, so although I can confirm it’s delicious, with a good crunch, I can’t say exactly what it’s like wrapped around an egg. The haggis proves a far more amenable victim, especially when mixed with peanut butter and oats – the texture is just right. However, it does taste of peanuts and cumin, neither of which are flavours I’d associate with a traditional scotch egg. Swapping the nuts for the similarly binding qualities of a raw egg, and the spices for mustard powder, mace and fresh herbs does the trick – and I’m also going to use crunchy pinhead oatmeal rather than rolled oats, because I think it gives the coating a more interesting texture.<br></div><div><br></div><div>I consider adapting my own vegetarian haggis recipe for the purpose, because the ready-made stuff feels like cheating, until I reflect that most ordinary scotch egg recipes begin with sausages and, really, in high summer, few of us want to spend any more time in the kitchen than we have to. There are several very good examples on the market all year round which are perfect for the role, and some brands will even ship internationally, although if you don’t live somewhere where it can be found in most large supermarkets, you may wish to do a bit of experimentation of your own.<br></div>
