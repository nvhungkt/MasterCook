The season for really good fruit is so short, and that fruit’s perfume so very delicate, that to gild the lily with anything other than a dollop of dairy would be sacrilege – as soon as it meets heat, that fresh acidity is gone for good. If you want to cook a strawberry, use this jam recipe. Occasionally, however, the occasion demands something a little fancier than a dish of fruit and cream – like a classic fruit tart, that pretty stalwart of the French patisserie with its shiny berries and crisp golden pastry. But what’s the best way to dress up summer’s first and, arguably, finest fruit without spoiling it?<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/09_1508985758501.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div><b>The pastry</b><br></div><div>The classic choice is pâte sucrée, a crisp, sweet shell rolled elegantly thin, and favoured by both chef Pascal Aussignac and Dr Tim Kinnaird in his book Perfecting Patisserie. As this title suggests, the latter gives very clear instructions on how to achieve sucrée success, starting by beating together the butter and sugar until fluffy, adding ground almonds and vanilla seeds, then slowly stirring in the egg before adding the flour all in one go because “the longer you take to incorporate [it] the greater the chance of developing too much gluten, which will make the pastry tough”.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Unlike the shortcrust I’m more familiar with, pâte sucrée dough is very soft and delicate, which makes chilling it for quite some time before baking mandatory if it’s not to collapse in the heat of the oven. Though undoubtedly delicious, it’s so much more of a faff than the rich, sandy shortcrusts deployed by Nigel Slater and the recipe in Rosemary Shrager’s Bakes, Cakes and Puddings that I’m disappointed none of the testers remark upon its delicacy. Perhaps in another, more highfalutin context, the difference would be evident, but for the simplest of fruit tarts I’m after here, such a palaver doesn’t seem quite necessary.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/09_1508985779338.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div>Martha Stewart’s pastry, however, makes even shortcrust look like a hassle. Flour, butter, sugar and salt are whizzed together to form damp crumbs (no liquid is added), which can then be pressed into a tart tin, frozen briefly to firm it up, and then baked. No rolling out to cope with, no floury surfaces to wipe afterwards, and the most delicious crunchy, buttery sandy result, rather like the crisp shortbread that pairs so well with a dish of strawberries and cream. It’s completely foolproof, which is frankly what one needs when dealing with pastry at the height of summer, and stupidly lovely. Sold. (I try to find out the proper name for this pastry via the learned medium of Twitter, and come to no firm conclusions – it’s either pie crust or an American version of shortcrust. If anyone can shed any further light on the matter, please do.)</div><div><br></div><div>Shrager flavours her pastry with orange zest, Kinnaird with vanilla, and Aussignac lemon thyme – all good things in themselves, but I’d prefer to keep things as plain as possible, to let the fruit itself shine. Feel free to ignore me if you wish.<br></div>
