Her GP diagnosed 'tension headaches', and she was keen to find an alternative to over-the-counter painkillers.</span><br></div><div><span style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 15px;">She skipped breakfast to squeeze in the school run, and grabbed snacks rather than eating at set times.
