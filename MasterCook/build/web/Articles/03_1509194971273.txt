When I realized that my cooking could bring happiness, I was hooked!</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nik:</span> My chef dad was often cooking at home for family & friends while I would help him set the table and be the host of the night. As I grew used to the kitchen, he would pile on more tasks for me until I started making Crepes Suzette for these dinner parties. Thats what got me into the kitchen!</div><div>What does cooking mean to me?</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sarah:</span> To me, cooking means knowing exactly what someone wants to eat and hitting that spot. There are lots of fancy chefs out there who are all about demonstrating their new ingredients and new techniques, and although I really love that kind of cooking, its not what I do. Im all about really figuring out what the perfect dish for the occasion is, and then getting everyone over to the table to dig in together.</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nik:</span> Generosity. Its about giving away a part of yourself in every meal. </div></span>

<span><div style="-en-clipboard:true;">What type of cuisine do I love to cook?</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sarah:</span> I come from a multicultural background, and I love to travel and discover new food, so I love so many different cuisines! Im a fan of bringing different cultures together with my food, but if I always come back to one cuisine for inspiration, it has to be Nyonya or Peranakan food. I think of Peranakan food as the original ‘fusion cuisine, blending Malay and Chinese flavors and techniques, so its something that I love to learn about and experiment with in the kitchen.</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nik:</span>This is a tough one. I love them all! Southeast Asian, Italian, French, American, Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, they are all amazing cuisines. But if I had to choose one to cook for the rest of my life, it would be Malaysian cuisine. Specifically, the ‘kampung kind of meals.</div></span>

<span><div style="-en-clipboard:true;">What does it mean to you when you hear “Love To Cook”</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sarah:</span> I love being in the kitchen, cooking up a storm, and making up new dishes. But for me, “Love to Cook” means more than just that. Loving to cook means putting your love into the food because of who youre about to feed it to. It could be your family, your friends, or even a group of people you dont know. On Cooking For Love, Ive cooked for families who want to celebrate together, and when you can feel the love between them, you know that you have to put love into your food, because I want them to be able to taste it.</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nik:</span> On our show Cooking For Love, both Sarah and I go head-to-head coming up with the best dish we can for our guests, but what prevails at the end of each cook off is (even though were super competitive with each other) the fact that our guests enjoyed themselves. Sometimes its one dish that invokes childhood memories, sometimes its the synergy between our dishes but in the end, as long as its a successful party, we love to cook.</div><div>One ingredient I love and would use it in every dish, if possible!</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sarah:</span> If I could only choose one ingredient to use in every dish, I would probably have to say… eggs! Eggs have got to be the most versatile ingredient ever – they are essentials in breakfast, they are a base for cakes and ice cream, and when youre cooking up a lovely, savory main course, adding a fried egg or poached egg with a gloriously golden runny yolk takes the whole dish to a new level.</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nik:</span> I believe a chefs love interest in an ingredient or dish is usually persuaded by their mood. It could be fast food on one day or a Michelin starred dish on another. At the moment, the Musang King Durian season is almost over in Malaysia and Im getting serious cravings for it. Brb, gonna go get some durian!</div></span>

<span><div style="-en-clipboard:true;">What has it been like working with each other for so many seasons and are you true rivals or best friends forever?</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sarah:</span> Working with Nik is always so much fun, he is like the little brother I always wanted. We have lots in common, mainly food! But we always have plenty to talk about in our downtime, whether its amazing holiday spots, TV Shows or just watching silly YouTube videos together. On party day though, were both laser focused on cooking until all the food is served, so that sense of rivalry always comes back then.</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nik:</span> I love working with Sarah. Its almost like shes the sibling I never had and since were the same age and grew up in the same 90s era, we relate on so many levels. I think there is a sense of rivalry there but she isnt as competitive as I am so it could be one sided!</div><div>Who will take home the crown for this season?</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sarah:</span> We dont really keep score because we approach each party as a separate event and I know Nik feels the same as me when I say that were always concentrating on doing our best to cook for the family of the moment at each party.</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nik:</span> I am hoping for another tie so it ends the season on a well-balanced note and drives through the contention of our guests because it is the most important part of the whole show, not the competitiveness.</div></span>
