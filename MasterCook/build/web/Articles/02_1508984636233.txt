<div><b>The tomatoes</b></div><div>The other most important ingredient in an arrabbiata sauce is, of course, tomatoes. Caz Hildebrand and Jacob Kenedy’s The Geometry of Pasta is the only book to call for fresh fruit, pureed and then cooked until they taste “fresh but no longer raw”. While this proves a delicious destination for the last of the season’s harvest, craggy and wrinkled as they are, testers express an overwhelming preference for the deeper, richer flavour of those made with tinned tomatoes, especially when well reduced, as in Gray and Rogers’ recipe. I don’t think there’s any need to puree them as Galette recommends – a good bash with a wooden spoon during cooking should do the trick, just enough to break them up and give a more interesting texture.<br></div><div><br></div><div>American chef Mario Batali adds a hefty amount of tomato puree to his sauce, too, perhaps because he doesn’t allow it to reduce before use – but an extra 15 minutes on the heat while the pasta cooks is well worth it.<br></div><div><br></div><img src="Pictures/02_1508984383723.jpg"><div><br></div><div><b>The extras</b></div><div>Advertisement Batali’s simple recipe, included in a New York Times feature about quick dinners after a long night in the kitchen, doesn’t even include garlic, though unless you too have been chopping all day, I’d advise adding it – and not just to season the oil as in Galletto’s version. He also adds guanciale (cured pork cheek), or pancetta, to his sauce, much like that other central Italian classic, pasta all’amatriciana, but I’m going to keep this vegetarian, both because it makes it more versatile, and because, in my slower-simmered method, the meat would quickly become chewy.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Jamie Oliver sticks in anchovies, which melt into the sauce, but again, good as they are with tomatoes (who doesn’t love puttanesca), the dish really doesn’t need them, and the same goes for his lemon zest, though the balancing sharpness of the juice he also adds inspires me to pop in just a drop of red wine vinegar, more appropriate for this store-cupboard classic, and one that I think pairs better with the other ingredients.</div><div><br></div><div>The most surprising ingredient in his version, however, is a slug of vodka, apparently a popular addition to pasta sauces in Italian-American cooking. It is alleged elsewhere to bring out the flavour of the tomatoes, but we can’t detect the difference – although everyone is very enthusiastic about going back for more, just to check.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/02_1508984397939.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div><b>The pasta</b></div><div>Penne is the usual choice, though having run out, I have to use rigatoni for the River Cafe iteration (sorry) and can confirm it is a perfectly serviceable alternative, while Oliver uses spaghetti, which doesn’t carry the sauce in quite the same way. I have to confess that penne has always seemed, as a friend puts it, a bit “basic” in the hierarchy of pasta shapes, so my own preference would be for something else with the capacity to trap lumps of tomato – Hildebrand and Kenedy give no fewer than 14 alternatives, including the wonderful sounding dischi volanti – but it will of course do if you’re a stickler for tradition.</div><div><br></div><div>Whatever shape you use, taking it to al dente and then adding it the hot tomatoey pan and allowing the two to finish cooking together will encourage the sauce to really coat the pasta, rather than just sitting on top of it.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/02_1508984428735.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div><b>The finishing</b></div><div>Advertisement Recipes are divided between those who believe cheese to be an aberration on an arrabbiata (Gray and Rogers, Hildebrand and Kenedy) and those who couldn’t care less, like Oliver and Batali, who both add parmesan, and Galletto, who goes for pecorino. I don’t think this particular dish needs it – a glug of good olive oil feels like a better pairing with chilli, but I can’t resist quoting The Geometry of Pasta on the subject: “best served without cheese in my opinion … some would disagree (they should use pecorino romano, but given their dubious taste are probably sprinkling parmesan).” </div><div><br></div><div>Oliver also stirs in flat-leaf parsley, which is a classic combination with tomatoes and chilli, but I like the sweetness of basil. If you have neither, however, no one will judge you for eating it as it is, straight out of the pan.<br></div>
