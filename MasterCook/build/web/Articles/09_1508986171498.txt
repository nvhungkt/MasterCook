Aussignac’s version is no exception, and proves popular with testers, although, like Kinnaird’s white chocolate ganache, most of us find it so sweet and rich that it steals the show from the fruit itself. The same goes for Shrager’s lemon curd filling, against which the poor old strawberries stand no chance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The simpler fillings favoured by Stewart and Slater prove a better pairing, with the latter’s subtly sweetened double cream and yoghurt edging ahead of the low-fat cream cheese and sugar mixture in Stewart’s tart on the grounds it tastes “lighter”. As this is generally felt to be a good thing, I’ll be using whipping cream, which sits somewhere between single and double varieties on fat content, though feel free to substitute double if it’s easier to come by. Do not, however, be tempted to replace thick whole milk yoghurt with the low-fat variety; it’ll make the mixture loose and unpleasantly sour. A little sugar is all you need. After all, both the fruit and the pastry will add sweetness – but feel free to add vanilla if you like, lemon zest or, my particular favourite, Slater’s rose water, another gloriously summery flavour.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/09_1508985991006.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div><b>The fruit</b></div><div>Kinnaird makes a strawberry and pink peppercorn jam to line the bottom of his tart, but, though we agreed we’d all eat this by the spoonful, in peak strawberry season it seems a shame to use anything but fresh fruit. It’s also, of course, much easier – you don’t even need to macerate the berries in pink wine and honey as Aussignac suggests, though the redcurrant glaze recommended by Stewart does make them look so attractively shiny that I can’t resist it.</div><div><br></div><div>Standing the fruit on its ends, as in Slater’s recipe, means you can cram more on there, though unfortunately I encountered a small supply error on the day I made mine, hence the slight dearth in the picture above. Put on as many as you can reasonably fit – this dessert is all about the strawberries, so gorge yourself before they’re gone for another year.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/09_1508986018971.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div>To make the pastry, put all the ingredients in a food processor and whizz until they look like damp ground almonds – this will probably take a minute or so. Tip into a loose-bottomed shallow tart tin about 25cm wide, spread out and press with a mug or glass until you have a pastry case. Put in the freezer for 15 minutes until firm. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C.</div><div><br></div><div>Prick the base all over with a fork, then bake for about 20-25 minutes until lightly golden (overcook it and it will be crumbly). Allow to cool in the tin, then gently transfer to a serving plate.</div><div><br></div><div>When the shell is cool, whip the cream to soft peaks, adding the sugar and rose water or other flavouring towards the end of the process, then fold in the yoghurt. Taste and add a little more sugar or flavouring (rose waters, in particular, can vary hugely in strength) if necessary then spoon into the tart shell and smooth.</div><div><br></div><div>Hull the strawberries and cut into quarters, or sixths if large, and then arrange, point upwards, in concentric circles. Heat the jelly in a small pan until liquid, then brush over the fruit and leave to set for at least 30 minutes before serving.<br></div>
