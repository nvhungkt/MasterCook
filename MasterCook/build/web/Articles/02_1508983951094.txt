<div><b>The dairy</b></div><div>Although it is certainly possible to make this dish vegan by using nut milks (cashew might be nice), carrot halwa is made traditionally with whole milk, slow simmered until it is rich and sweet. Todiwala is the only chef to use milk alone, cooking it gently with the carrots for almost an hour – a process, he writes in Mr Todiwala’s Bombay, that is “better not rushed”. Patel throws caution to the wind and boils the milk hard, “stirring continuously”, then adds some milk powder at the end to help thicken the dish and “absorb any excess moisture from the carrots”. It also gives her halwa the slightly grainy texture that I consider characteristic of many Indian sweets. If you’re not a fan, leave it out.<br></div><div><br></div><img src="Pictures/02_1508983545676.jpg"><div><br></div><div>Usmani cooks her carrots in a blend of milk and double cream, heavily weighted towards the latter, which lends her halwa the luxurious richness of an excellent rice pudding. Everyone else accelerates the process with either evaporated or condensed milk, or a mixture of these and fresh milk. While the classic recipe is lovely – and thick, gloopy condensed milk gives the dessert what Gowardhan describes as “a really nice gooey, fudgey consistency” – I am surprised how popular the slightly caramelised tang of evaporated milk proves with my testers. It gives Singh’s dessert a complex, interesting flavour – and cuts the preparation time considerably. Double win.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Usmani’s is the only recipe not to use ghee or butter, but, unless you are equally free with the double cream, this is a dessert that really needs a bit of butter – otherwise, it’s just grated carrot with a bit of sugar.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/02_1508983552554.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div><b>The sweetener</b></div><div>Speaking of sugar, those carrots need to be sweetened with something. White sugar seems to be the standard choice (caster will dissolve fastest), but Sodha’s use of jaggery, or unrefined palm sugar, for her garnish is intriguing: it strikes me that its treacly notes would work well with the caramelised flavours in the pudding. With jaggery being hard to find outside Asian grocers, soft brown sugar would make a decent substitute. Feel free to use either – or, indeed, white sugar, if you are after a simpler, more vibrantly coloured halwa.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Similarly, if you would prefer a sliceable sweet to a spoonable pudding, keep cooking the mixture until it is dry and crumbly, as Todiwala describes it, then smooth into a dish and allow to cool before cutting into squares.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/02_1508983557420.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div><b>The fruit, nuts and spices</b></div><div>Not only is this a pudding made of vegetables, but it is also studded with fruit and nuts – stick a bit of coconut oil and date syrup in there and you could almost call it “clean”. Use whatever you have to hand – almonds, pistachios, desiccated coconut and raisins are popular – but take a tip from Gowardhan and add any dried fruit during the cooking process; “the heat of the pudding will ... puff up the raisins, making them taste even better”. If you are really looking to impress, nuts caramelised in butter and sugar that is lightly spiced with garam masala, as Sodha suggests, make for a fancy garnish.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Spice has a role to the play in the pudding, too: cardamom is the most popular flavouring in the recipes that I try. Daley and Hirani also add nutmeg, while Usmani opts for cloves and saffron, all of which prove delicious. Saffron seems like a wise bet as much for its vivid colour as its delicate perfume, but, if you use only one spice, zesty cardamom would be my choice; its freshness is the perfect foil for the rich sweetness of the carrot.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/02_1508983572876.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div><b>Spring rolls, anyone?</b></div><div>In Vivek Singh’s Indian Festival Feasts, the chef writes that, although there is “something special” about the dish at Diwali,“the idea of having bowl after bowl of rich, sweet halwa seems less and less appealing”.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>The perfect carrot halwa</b><br></div><div>Squash the cardamom pods to remove the seeds, then roughly crush these to a powder in a pestle and mortar. Heat the ghee in a wide, heavy-based pan on a medium high heat and fry the powder for a minute or so until aromatic, then add the grated carrot and a pinch of salt.</div><div><br></div><div>Fry for five minutes on a medium heat, then turn up the heat and fry for another five, stirring all the time. Repeat if necessary until the carrots are soft and dryish – this should take 10-15 minutes in total.</div><div><br></div><div>Pour in the evaporated milk, add the saffron and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to medium and simmer, stirring regularly, until most of the liquid has evaporated.</div><div><br></div><div>Add the sugar and dried fruit and continue cooking, stirring so the mixture doesn’t catch, until thickened, then stir in the milk powder if using and cook for another minute or so. Allow to cool slightly before serving with the nuts on top.<br></div>
