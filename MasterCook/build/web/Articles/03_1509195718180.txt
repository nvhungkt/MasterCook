This cosmopolitan city boasts of a vibrant nightlife which provides both locals and tourists alike with great locations for excellent eats and amazing buys at affordable prices. You definitely wont be left feeling hungry or bored with nothing to do in the middle of the night. With this <span style="font-weight: bold;">Late Night Guide</span>, well give you a rundown of the citys best local haunts to get you started on your very own nocturnal adventure.</div></span><span><div>EAT</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mamink Daeng Tata</span></div><div>Jalan Casablanca No. 33, Manggarai Selatan, Tebet, RT.13/RW.5, Bukit Duri, RT.18/RW.1, Tebet Bar., Tebet, Kota Jakarta Selatan, Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta 12840, Indonesia</div><div>Operating hours: 9am to 9pm</div></div></span>

<span><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;-en-clipboard:true;">You cant possibly go around exploring the city on an empty stomach! At Mamink Daeng Tata, you get to enjoy a hearty meal at a great price, with each food item ranging from 30,000 to 58,000 Rupiah. The most expensive item in their menu is their signature grilled beef ribs, more commonly known as Tata Ribs. Topped with rich peanut sauce, these tender, juicy ribs are full of flavor and they taste even better when eaten with a squeeze of lime. Served with rice and soup, this makes for a complete meal to give you that extra boost of energy to get you through the night.</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Besides the ribs, this humble no-frills restaurant also offers a variety of delicious Indonesian dishes from the Makassar region in South Sulawesi – from Coto Makassar (spiced beef and offal stew) to Nasi Goreng Merah, which literally translates to Red Fried Rice. From our experience, seats get snapped up pretty quickly so do head over to the restaurant early to avoid disappointment!</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bang! Martabak</span></div><div>Jl. Panglima Polim Raya No.102, RT.1/RW.5, Kramat Pela, Jakarta Selatan, Kota Jakarta Selatan, Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta 12160, Indonesia</div><div>Opening hours: 10am to 12am</div></div></span>

<span>You havent really been to Jakarta unless youve tried this popular street-side snack. Martabak Manis is a griddled pancake which comes in many different flavors and fillings. It is also known as Terang Bulan (which means moonlight) in some parts of Indonesia due to its resemblance to the moon. Spongy, fluffy, soft in the middle and crispy around the edges, it is the ultimate guilty pleasure. After one bite, youll be wondering where this gooey, sinful treat has been all your life.
<br><br></span><img src="Pictures/03_1509195364781.jpg"><br>
<span><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;-en-clipboard:true;">At Bang! Martabak, you have the option of getting Nutella, Green tea, Oreo and even Durian flavored martabak. However, if you prefer to stick with the classics, you cant go wrong with their best-seller – the Classic Complete, which includes a generous amount of chocolate sprinkles, cheese, sesame seeds and condensed milk. Buttery, chocolatey, cheesy and nutty all in one sweet pancake, theres no doubt that youll get the much needed sugar rush to power through the night.</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Feel free to share this with a group of friends as the portions can get pretty big. We wont tell if you decide to have one all to yourself, though!</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">BEAU By Talita Setyadi</span></div><div>Jalan Cikajang No. 29, RT. 01 / RW. 05, Petogogan, Kebayoran Baru, RT.1/RW.5, Petogogan, Kby.

<span>Theres no better place to grab breakfast than at BEAU. Opened by talented Indonesian pastry chef, Talita Setyadi, who was culinary-trained at Le Cordon Bleu, this artisanal bakery is said to have the best bakes and pastries in town.
</span>

<br><br><img src="Pictures/03_1509195378884.jpg"><br><br>
<span>What makes the food here so good? Well, all their bread is baked on site for maximum freshness and Chef Talita believes in using mostly locally-sourced ingredients and spices with no artificial flavorings added to any of their food.

<img src="Pictures/03_1509195398197.jpg"><br><span><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;-en-clipboard:true;">One of our favorites is the Blackout Éclair. To incorporate an Indonesian twist to the dish, Kecap Manis, or sweet soy sauce caramel is used to enhance the flavors, resulting in a more decadent dessert that is just to die for! This is definitely no ordinary éclair!</div></span><span><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Aside from their bakes, their Eggs Benedict seemed very popular (we spied a couple of tables ordering this particular dish). The poached eggs are served on a tall piece of Brioche with either salmon, pastrami, prosciutto or even spinach, if youre opting to go vegetarian. This, of course, will be topped with a generous serving of Hollandaise sauce!</div><div>SHOP</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tulisan</span></div><div>Jl.

<span>Take a break from the food and check out Jakartas inspiring art and design scene.

<br><br><img src="Pictures/03_1509195415637.jpg"><br><span><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;-en-clipboard:true;">Once you enter the shop, its easy to get drawn in by the bright intricate designs and soon enough, you might find yourself immersed in the storytelling and somewhat entranced by Indonesias diverse culture. If and when you do decide to buy something from the shop, itll make you feel like youre taking a part of Jakarta home with you.</div></span><span><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rawa Belong Flower Market</span></div><div>Jalan Sulaiman No.56, RT.10/RW.3, Sukabumi Utara, Kebon Jeruk, RT.10/RW.3, Sukabumi Utara, Kb.

One might be surprised to find that its home to Southeast Asias largest wholesale flower market, known as Pasar Bunga Rawa Belong or Rawa Belong Flower Market. Open throughout the day, the market offers a wide variety of beautiful flowers at a bargain since the vendors usually get their supply straight from the farmers. Aside from home-grown flora, the market also sells imported flowers from Thailand, Vietnam and even all the way from the Netherlands!</div></span>

<img src="Pictures/03_1509195420145.jpg">
<span><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;-en-clipboard:true;">Explore the market and get lost in the vibrant display of colourful flowers as you take a stroll along the narrow pathways. From individuals stalks to beautifully arranged bouquets, youll never know when something might catch your eye! Most vendors dont accept cards, so be sure to bring cash and loose change.</div><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">A thriving metropolis, Jakarta definitely does not disappoint when it comes to food and culture.
