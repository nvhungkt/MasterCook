<div>Diwali, the Hindu festival of light also celebrated by Sikhs, Jains and some Buddhists, falls today and continues until Saturday. Spiritually, it signifies the triumph of good over evil, hope over despair and knowledge over ignorance. Culinarily, it mainly delivers sugar. Crumbly laddoo, fudgey barfi, sticky gulab jamun and creamy kheer are just a few of the dizzying array of sweet snacks that will fuel the busy round of family visits, ceremonies and parties this week.<br></div><div><br></div><img src="Pictures/02_1508983038097.jpg"><div><br></div><div>Diwali is a golden opportunity to crack out a few regional specialities from around the subcontinent – syrup-soaked mung beans, Rajasthani cream fritters, rice flour doughnuts and many, many others – but halwa is a near-universal treat: a sweet, buttery pudding made with everything from mung beans to pineapples, but which is often carrot-based.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Carrots are grown in abundance in the UK and are cheap and healthy, so gajar ka halwa offers the perfect excuse to crack open the celebratory sugar and ghee. As Meera Sodha puts it in Fresh India: “If eating carrots as a pudding strikes you as odd, remember how good a spiced carrot cake is. This isn’t too distant a cousin.”<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/02_1508983046774.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div><b>The carrots</b></div><div>Although a carrot is a carrot, the native variety – “deep red, sweet and intensely crunchy” is how Pakistani food writer Sumayya Usmani describes them in Mountain Berries and Desert Spice – tends to be favoured for this dish. The taste is similar, but our orange versions can’t compete on colour; she suggests adding a little natural red food colouring if you want your dish to look more authentic.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/02_1508983054694.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div>The chef Kaushy Patel uses finely grated carrot in her book Prashad, giving her recipe a more homogenous consistency. My testers preferred a chunkier texture, although this will make the halwa take slightly longer to cook, so follow Patel’s lead if you are in a hurry.</div><div><br></div><div>Simon Daley and Roshan Hirani, in their book Cooking With My Indian Mother-in-Law, start by boiling the grated carrot in water, while chef Cyrus Todiwala recommends something similar, with added ghee. As usual, the less healthy option proves more delicious – softening the carrot by sautéing it in ghee, as chefs from Vivek Singh to Maunika Gowardhan recommend, seems to give the vegetable a more intense flavour.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/02_1508983063755.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div>Patel supplies another helpful tip for time-pressed cooks: “Constant stirring and varying the temperature during frying both help to speed up the process of cooking off the carrot juice.”<br></div>
