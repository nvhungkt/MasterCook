Mapping out your wilderness nutrition needs is important: There's plenty to consider besides simply grabbing an energy bar or a bottle of water. Follow these tips to ensure you have a nourishing and safe food experience on your next outdoor adventure.<br></div><div><h4>Have a Plan</h4><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Your food and water needs are generally higher than usual on activity-based excursions. Pay extra special attention to packing plenty of fluids for hot weather adventures. Some other key considerations before your hiking or camping trip include:</div><ul><li>Length of the trip</li><li>What foods and beverages you'll carry</li><li>How you'll eat and drink</li><li>If bringing a cooler is an option</li><li>What food-related tools you'll need</li></ul><h4>It's Essential to Stay Hydrated</h4><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Pre-hydrate by drinking at least 4 cups of water before a hike so you have less to carry. Then, a good rule of thumb is to plan for about 2 cups of fluid for every hour of hiking.</div><h4>For a Hike or Day Trip...</h4><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">You actually can pack perishable foods, such as sandwiches, just be sure you have a cold source (such as an ice pack) to keep foods properly chilled to below 40°F. The more you stash in a backpack, the harder it is to hike, so opt mainly for non-perishable foods that are relatively lightweight and nutrient dense, such as:</div><ul><li>Trail mix</li><li>Nuts, seeds, nut-based bars or nut butter packs</li><li>Dried or freeze-dried fruits and veggies</li><li>Energy bars, chews or gels</li><li>Granola or granola bars</li><li>Ready-made tuna salad pouches</li><li>Whole-grain tortillas</li><li>Poultry, salmon or meat jerky</li></ul><h4>For Camping or Multi-Day Trips...</h4><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">It's a little more challenging to pack food for days at a time. The first day you'll be able to eat perishable foods; but after that, map out your meals so you'll have what you enjoy and need. If you have a cooler, you'll have numerous options. Otherwise, include any of these shelf-stable, easily-packed basics to sustain you:</div><ul><li>Easy-to-carry foods mentioned above</li><li>Ready-to-eat cereal</li><li>Fruit or vegetable puree in squeezable pouches (yes, like baby food)</li><li>Poultry or fish pouches, or canned fish, poultry or meat in individual or regular servings</li><li>Individual packets of mayo, mustard, taco sauce and/or soy sauce</li><li>Whole-grain pasta, couscous, rice mix, pancake mix, hot cereal, dried soups and dehydrated foods (if you have the ability to boil water)</li><li>Marshmallows — for a campfire dessert, of course</li><li>Bottled water, and possibly powdered beverage mixes</li></ul><h4>Don't Forget Proper Food Safety Practices</h4><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Always follow good food safety practices — from packing to plating. Remember that perishable food cannot be kept out in hot weather (90°F or higher) for more than one hour; in mild weather for more than two hours. Bring these food safety essentials:</div><ul><li>Disposable wipes, moist towelettes or biodegradable soap</li><li>Bowls and plates</li><li>Kettle or cooking pot</li><li>Eating and cooking utensils</li><li>Can opener</li><li>Ice packs, if applicable</li><li>Trash bags</li><li>Portable water filters or water purification tablets</li><li>Thermometers for cooler and cooked meat, if applicable</li></ul><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">And follow these food safety rules:</div><ul><li>Wash hands often. This includes before and after eating. Moist towelettes work fine.</li><li>Keep raw meats and ready-to-eat foods separate. Use extra plates that you've packed — one for raw and one for prepared foods.</li><li>Cook to proper temperatures. Use a food thermometer to be sure cooked food has reached a <a href="http://www.eatright.org/resource/homefoodsafety/four-steps/cook/complete-list-of-cooking-temperatures">safe internal temperature</a>.</li><li>Refrigerate promptly below 40°F. Of course, if you don't have a fridge, pack perishable food, including meat or poultry, with plenty of ice or ice packs in a well-insulated cooler to keep the temperature below 40°F. Store leftovers in the cooler only if it still has ice. And keep the cooler in as cool a place as possible.</li></ul><div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Now, take a hike!</div></div>
