<div>If I had to eat one cuisine forever more, I think it would probably be Italian – and not just because a world without spaghetti carbonara feels like a very bleak place indeed. The sheer variety, from the potato dumplings of the Dolomites to the saffron-spiked couscous of Sicily, has much to do with it; plus the fact that – unlike, say, traditional French, or British cooking – it is not shy of a bit of heat. Not only does the south produce a lot of very fine peperoncino, but, as Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers explain in the River Cafe Classic Italian Cook Book, “in Italy, many cooks grow their own chillies” – something that is less easy for those of us in somewhat chillier climes.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Pasta all’arrabbiata, a dish apparently native to Rome, is a case in point: the name refers to the “angry” heat of the chilli-spiked tomato sauce – though it’s up to you, of course, exactly how furious you’d like it to be. (Chef Lucio Galletto recalls coming across it in the Eternal City as a teenager: “The waiter asked, ‘Would you like it really angry?’ and my brother, thinking that was a standard joke, replied, ‘Yes, really, really angry – arrabbiatissimo.’ When the pasta arrived, it was inedible!”)<br></div><div><br></div><img src="Pictures/02_1508984119510.jpg"><div><br></div><div>However hot you dare to go, though, this is a simple, quick and satisfyingly spicy supper using store cupboard ingredients that doesn’t even require the minimal motor skills of those other late night favourites, carbonara or cacio e pepe. A very useful recipe to have up your utterly exhausted, or slightly inebriated, sleeve, in other words.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>The chillies</b></div><div>Advertisement As the thing that distinguishes arrabbiata from the tens, possibly hundreds of other tomato-based sauces in the Italian repertoire, the chilli element feels important. Gray and Rogers go on to say that in Italy, home-grown chillies are “hung upside down to dry in the autumn” to keep the household going until the following year, and the chillies used at the restaurant where they ate penne all’arrabbiata “at least once a week during the summer” used their own peppers, “dried and strong”.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/02_1508984131827.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div>That said, Jamie Oliver and Galletto’s book, The Art of Pasta, both call for fresh red chillies, the first added whole, and cooked until they break down into the sauce, and the latter finely chopped. The effect is surprisingly fruity rather than fiery; no doubt a different variety could be used with better effect, but the keener heat of the dried kind proves more popular. Gray and Rogers go for a whole dried pepper, but I find chilli flakes more effective at perfuming the oil (and be generous: a decent amount of oil is necessary in such a simple sauce).<br></div><div><br></div><div>(Note the amount in the recipe below gives a warm but not overpowering heat; if you’d prefer to have your socks knocked off, you may wish to add a little more.)<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/02_1508984146220.jpg"></div>
