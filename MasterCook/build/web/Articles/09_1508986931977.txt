Should you wish for a liquid centre, Erskine’s six-minute eggs are just perfect. Either way, I’d recommend rolling them in flour before coating, as this will help the haggis mixture to adhere to their shiny surface.</div><div><br></div><div>Reed uses duck eggs, which are both meatier and more substantial. If you go down that road, you will probably need to increase the quantities of the other ingredients by about a third to account for their larger size.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/09_1508986691533.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div><b>The coating</b><br></div><div>Meldrum coats them in rolled oats and Hart in mixed seeds but, for a traditional scotch egg feel, it has to be breadcrumbs, and preferably the dried variety (panko, if you have them, will add extra crunch). The usual flour, egg, crumb routine is the best bet for a robust outer shell – go for two layers for a good bite.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/09_1508986702605.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div><b>The cooking</b><br></div><div>Hart and Meldrum both bake their eggs in a hot oven, but this is not a course I’d recommend unless in dire emergency – not only will your eggs come out very firmly hard-boiled, but without the fat that lubricates a pork sausagemeat coating, they will also be rather dry. Deep-fat frying gives infinitely superior results, and needn’t be intimidating as long as you’re careful. Trust me, these are worth it.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/09_1508986729309.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div><b>Perfect vegetarian scotch eggs</b><br></div><div>Put 4 of the eggs in a pan, cover with cold water and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, then plunge into a sink of cold water to cool.</div><div><br></div><div>Meanwhile, crumble the haggis into a bowl and stir in the herbs, spices and oatmeal. Beat one of the remaining eggs and add to the mixture.</div><div><br></div><div>Put the flour in a shallow bowl, the final egg, beaten with a splash of milk, in a second, and the breadcrumbs in a third.</div><div><br></div><div>When cool enough to handle, roll the eggs along a hard surface to crack the shells, then carefully peel. Roll each in the flour, then take about a quarter of the mixture into one palm and flatten it slightly. Put the egg in the middle and close the coating around it. Repeat with the other eggs, and then if you have time, put the eggs in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm up.</div><div><br></div><div>When you’re ready to cook, roll the eggs in the flour, followed by the egg, followed by the breadcrumbs. Repeat the last two layers if you have enough left to do so.</div><div><br></div><div>Fill a deep pan a third full of oil and heat to 170C (or when a crumb of bread dropped in sizzles and turns golden, but does not burn). Gently lower in the eggs and cook for about 5 minutes until crisp and golden, then drain on kitchen paper.<br></div>
