Ottolenghi also whips in some mascarpone, and the Honeys use the kind of soft, salty feta style cheese sold in tins in Middle Eastern food shops. The condensed milk is disqualified because it makes the topping cloyingly sweet – and cream in all its forms feels ridiculously rich. Mascarpone is beautifully smooth and silky, but, again, makes the topping a bit too dense and buttery. The feta wins hearts for the subtle saline quality it brings to the party, but loses technical points for its slight graininess and lack of general availability.<br></div><div><br></div><div>We decide that something lighter would be a better balance. Mild, milky ricotta proves happy to take on the best-supporting role to the cream cheese: the resulting filling won’t be as smooth as the cream variety, but neither will it be as heavy or cloying – a trade-off I’m willing to make for the sake of being able to enjoy a larger slice.</div><div><br></div><div>On the subject of cream cheese, after this week’s experimentation I would stress that not all varieties are created equal, so, if you can, seek out some that’ is less sloppy and more interesting than the Kraft sort. There are some excellent Breton varieties available in some supermarkets, and no doubt some lovely local ones being made around the country. The better it tastes, the better your cheesecake will.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/09_1508985430952.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div><b>Flavouring and setting</b></div><div>Because cream cheeses vary in flavour, it’s impossible to be precise about the level of seasoning required, but it may be useful to know that honey is more popular than sugar, and lemon wins more fans than vanilla. There’s no reason you can’t use both if you so desire (or indeed any other essence, spice or sweetener that springs to mind). That said, I’d be careful of chopped fresh fruit because the strawberries in Grigson’s recipe leak quite a lot of juice into the filling. Save that for the top.</div><div><br></div><div>If you’re looking to transport the cheesecake any distance, then consider setting it with gelatine as Grigson suggests, but otherwise a fridge should do the trick while keeping it vegetarian-friendly. (The slightly wobbly jellied texture that gelatine brings isn’t to everyone’s taste, so if you do use it, consider adding a beaten egg white as Grigson does, to create a moussey effect.)<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Topping</b></div><div>Again, the blank creamy canvas allows a certain amount of latitude when it comes to topping – you can go fancy and make a greengage compote and an infused olive oil to drizzle on top, as Ottolenghi recommends; or a honey syrup and roasted almond and herb sprinkle, as the Honeys do. You can, like Grigson, even make a strawberry sauce but I’m with Parks: all you need here is a generous scattering of fruit. Plums, figs and berries are all good at the moment – and of course, frozen fruits of the forest mix is always in season.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/09_1508985443834.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div>Heat the oven to 180C and lightly grease a roughly 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Melt the butter and stir in the syrup or sugar and salt.</div><div><br></div><div>Roughly bash the cornflakes to break them up slightly and then stir in the butter and syrup and press the cornflakes firmly into the base of the tin with a glass or similar. Bake for six minutes until golden and then allow to cool completely.</div><div><br></div><div>Meanwhile, drain the ricotta and then beat into the cream cheese until smooth (this is most easily done with a food processor if you have one). Add honey, plus the finely grated zest of the lemon and the juice of half of it, then taste and adjust as necessary. (I also like to add another pinch of salt, but you may not.)</div><div><br></div><div>Spoon on top of the cooled base and chill for at least two hours until firm, then top with fruit to serve.<br></div>
