<img src="Pictures/09_1508985069917.jpg"><div><br></div><div>When I was growing up in the 80s, cheesecake came in two varieties: half defrosted from a Sara Lee packet – for special occasions – or served (not quite often enough) in enormous refrigerated slabs at school.</div><div><br></div><div>Both were topped with a vividly gloopy fruits-of-the-forest mix, but, where Sara’s was dense and painfully sweet, even to my eight-year-old palate, the redoubtable school meals supervisors, with their customary deft hands in the pudding department, always nailed the dish. I have no idea what they put in it (although the biscuit base may have been cobbled together from staffroom scraps), but, to this day, I have a fatal weakness for the set cheesecake over the far older baked variety. If I’m never allowed into the baked cheesecake’s spiritual home of New York again, in consequence, it will be well worth it.</div><div><br></div><div>Even though the silky fridge cake is certainly quicker and easier to make than its fluffy cousin, it’s surprisingly hard to achieve the perfect combination of rich-but-not-overly-so topping, while keeping the base satisfyingly crunchy. And, believe me, I have tried. What is the secret to this cheat’s cheesecake?<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/09_1508985094029.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div><b>The base</b></div><div>Let’s start at the bottom. Most set cheesecakes, whether made by Sara Lee or school cooks, have a base made from crushed biscuits – usually graham crackers in the US and digestive biscuits here. But the pastry chef Stella Parks disagrees, on the basis that “an unbaked graham cracker crust tastes a little blah”. Even without the “nutty, toasty flavours that develop in the oven, Biscoff cookies add a welcome depth of flavour”. Biscoff (the intensely sweet, spiced Belgian biscuits often handed out with a cup of coffee) are considerably easier to get hold of in this country than graham crackers, but testers find them too sugary and, once reduced to crumbs, deficient in the crisp-snap department.</div><div><br></div><div>In place of the elusive grahams in Martha Stewart’s recipe, I try a mixture of malted milk (for flavour) and rich tea (for texture). The consistency of the base is good – better, in fact, than the digestive used by Sophie Grigson, which feel slightly bland and soft in comparison – but the panel’s faith in cheesecake convention is swayed by Yotam Ottolenghi’s hazelnut and black sesame crumble (which he scatters on top of the cheese and fruit rather than underneath) and the crunchy nests of kadaif pastry used by Sarit Packer and Itamar Srulovich in the book Honey & Co. Kadaif (if, like me, you’d never heard of it) is like shredded filo; mixed with butter and a little sugar and then baked, it becomes incredibly crisp and light, almost like a bird’s nest. It’s the perfect counterpoint to rich dairy and sweet fruit.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="Pictures/09_1508985126012.jpg"></div><div><br></div><div>The problem is that these two maverick bases have to go on top, rather than beneath, the filling, and I’m not bold enough to advocate a deconstructed cheesecake as the perfect version. Also, kadaif is not the easiest ingredient to get hold of. I ponder the problem for some time before hitting on a perfect, if less glamorous, substitute: cornflakes. Crisper and lighter than biscuits, as any five-year-old baker will attest, they remain aggressively crunchy when mixed with butter and sugar (or golden syrup for interest’s sake) – and become pretty damn delicious, too.</div><div><br></div><div>Following advice online (cornflake crusts were once all the rage in the US) I experiment with whizzing them to smithereens before use, but the overwhelming preference is for larger, crunchier flakes which feel less dense than biscuit crumbs, while still providing solid foundations for the entire enterprise. After some experimentation I can confirm that, although you can make a decent base without heat, a brief blast in an oven gives a more robust result that’s easier to lift out of the tin without crumbling – either way, make sure you press the flakes well into the tin to bind them together as much as possible.<br></div>
